# Let's Build A Simple Interpreter: PascalScript

A JavaScript implementation of an interpreter for a subset of Pascal.

Based on:

The goal is not only to build an interpreter, but also a toy IDE / sandbox for this language in the browser.

Stretch goal: Rewrite the interpreter part in C and compile to WASM, for the sake of learning C and WASM.
